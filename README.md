# KIOSKS MANAGEMENT MODULE

## Description
This module allows you to manage manufactured vending kiosks licensed to vendors, send reminders etc. The idea is that there are may informal vending kiosks that are non standard,  run informally, usually unlicensed, have low aesthetic appeal and not trackable for revenue collection. Manufactured kiosks are an ideal solution where they are manufactured in a standard way and either leased or sold to willing vendors. These may be made using eco friendly materials, are standardised and uniform and fit for purpose e.g. food, clothes, groceries and are aestheically pleasing allowing for portablity and revenue generation through advertising. Enhancements that need to be made are transactions i.e. 
Payments and refunds for when vendors pay for their leases or licenses and integration with base odoo modules like account and invoicing
